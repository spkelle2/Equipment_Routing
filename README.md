# Equipment Routing Documentation

Hi there!

This repo includes some wrappers and functions I made for modeling a single
commodity delivery network, where all demands are at least as large as our
delivery vehicles' capacities. I used this for modeling the delivery of
construction equipment (thus the name!). The purpose of this repo is to help
anyone interested understand the size of fleet they should invest in to meet
their single-commodity network demands.

For detailed information, you're welcome to peruse the code, but I highly
suggest you check out [my documentation](http://ec2-35-166-156-114.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/)
which can also be found as a pdf in this repo as well.

I hope my work is of use to you!

Best,
Sean
